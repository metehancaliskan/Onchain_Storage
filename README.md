# Onchain_Storage
## The problem Onchain Storage solves
Onchain Storage makes data storage on the blockchain, easier and more reliable for users by using IPFS technology. The difference between Onchain Storage from similar projects is that while storing data on the blockchain, it gives the user a password to access this data. Thanks to this password, users can access their data more securely from another browser or computer.

## Challenges I ran into
At first I wrote a very different encryption algorithm and wanted to update IPFS by forking this system, but I did not have the knowledge to integrate this algorithm into IPFS fork. I started learning solidity 4 months ago, so I changed the project. Secondly, I wanted to try this encryption algorithm on the link that IPFS gave to access the data. Again, my code knowledge was not enough to do this. Also, if I could do it, I wouldn't do it because it would be a very central project.
